Special thanks to YellowAfterLife for his extensions (without which, this wouldn't be possible):
- Window freeze fix: https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/window-freeze-fix
- Native mouselock (gitignored): https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gamemaker-native-mouselock
  - paid extension, please buy it for $1 and import into the project for it to work correctly
- Desktop Screenshots (gitignored): https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gamemaker-display-screenshot
  - Used for creating holes in the window, another paid extension.
- GMLive (gitignored and not needed) another paid extension also used for this project, if this game is still in development you have to get rid of any live_call() fuctions (this will be done in the final build of the game)
