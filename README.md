  - Used for creating holes in the window/capturing display, another paid extension.
- GMLive (gitignored and not needed) another paid extension also used for this project ~~if this game is still in development you have to get rid of any live_call() fuctions (this will be done in the final build of the game)~~ live calls are commented out
